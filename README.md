# RC_Car
My ongoing design for a SMALL RC Car 3D printable on a small resin printer driven by Arduino. Currently included here are the schematics, PCB design (PCB prints are of course optional, but help decrease the footprint), and the INO files. As I get together a 3D print design I will add that also.

Not really ready for prime time, but uploading as I go. Gonna optimize the code more and allow controller joysticks to adjust power of the motors.

I learned to use the nRF modules from HowToMechatronics so check out that site. There are some good tutorials there.

Code uses the freely available libraries for nRF24 and SPI.

I used what I have so far to hack a small RC Car. You can see it here on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/jjs9hx/my_kids_rc_car_stopped_working_so_i_hacked_it/
